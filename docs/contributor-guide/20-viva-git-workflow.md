# **VIVA+ Git Workflow**

This section gives an overview of the workflow we follow for collaborative development of VIVA+ Models.

<!--- 
If you are new to git Workflow, you can find a brief introduction in the [Git Basics](../22-git-basics).
Other commonly used git functions are described in the [More Git Functions](../25-more-git-functions) section.

A brief overview of the git Workflow is provided here, but detailed help can be found in the
[Merging your contributions](../50-merge-guidelines) section. -->


!!! note "Introduction to Git: VIVA+ Workshop"
    
    A brief introduction to Git and workflow using branches can be found on the [VIVA Workshop handouts](https://viva-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-1-git-overview/)


??? tip "Installing and Configuring Git" 
        
    === "Windows"

        Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). You will be able to use Git from PowerShell, Git Bash, and Anaconda Command Prompt after you install. It is recommended to keep the defaults during installation.

    === "Linux"

        Use your package management system to install and update Git.
        ```    
        sudo apt-get install git
        ```

    === "macOS"

        Easiest way is to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and run the following:

        ```
        > brew install git
        ```

        To update your Git install, use Homebrewâ€™s upgrade option:

        ```
        > brew upgrade git
        ```

        Graphical installer for Git on macOS is available at the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). 

    
    **Configuring your Git installation**

    Before you use Git for the first time, you will need set up your name and email address. Run the following commands with your name and email address

    ```
    > git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
    ```

    ```
    > git config --global user.email "name@email.com"
    ```

## Step 1: **Clone** the model

_(Skip this step if you alrady have the VIVA+ repo on your computer)_

`git clone git@virtual.openvt.eu:fem/viva/plus.git`

## Step 2: Start an **Issue**

Start an issue on the online repo to let other users know and discuss the changes you propose.

## Step 3: Make a **Branch** to work on

#### Making a branch from `master` branch!

Create a branch `BranchName` for your development.

```
git checkout -b BranchName
```

??? tip "Git commands for branches" 
        

    `git checkout -b BranchName` is shorthand for:

    ```
    git branch BranchName
    git checkout BranchName
    ```

<!-- 
#### Make a branch from online VIVA+ repo
 -->

## Step 4: Saving your work as you go: **Commit**

Use `git add` to stage the files you want save (to index/staging area) and then `git commit` to take a snapshot of the staging area

```
git add FileNames
git commit -m "Commit message heading"
```

!!! Note "Guidelines for making commits"
    - Stage related files together from the working directory and perform the commit, rather than staging all the changed files for a bulk commit
    - Follow the commit message guidelines for VIVA+ models (read below)


!!! Info "How to write a commit message"
    - The commit heading gives a brief overview of changes involved
        - Specify the context of the change, for example, repository section (Model:, Docs:)
    - Commit message: If you would like to write more details of the commit, use the commit message body

A brief introduction to making `git commit` can be found in the [VIVA+ workshop handouts](https://viva-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-3-git-basic-workflow/)

## Step 5: **Push** your branch to the online repo

Make your commits available on the online repo so that it has a backup and also visible to other developers.

```
git push origin BranchName
```

??? Warning "Warning: Before you push"
    Some applications interfere with `git push` and cause merge conflicts.
    Please close these applications before you merge branches to avoid merge conflicts.

    Applications to close:

        - Microsoft Excel (if you have a CSV file open)
        - JabRef (if you use it to edit BibTeX files)

## Step 6: Run the Models 


### Getting the updates from master

The model may have had updates while you worked on your changes and it is a good practice to test run your changes along with the updates on the model.

To merge the updates from the master branch into your branch, first make sure the Git `HEAD` is on your branch

```
git checkout your-branch-name
```

Then merge the updates on the master into your branch
```
git merge master
```

### **Model Tests**



!!! warning "Work in Progress"

    These model tests will be run to verify the performance and response of the model
        



## Step 7: **Merging** your updates to the master branch

Once your changes are available on the online repo, you are ready to submit a **merge request** to the maintainer for review and merging to the master branch.

Select the branch you want to merge as the source branch and `master` as the target branch
