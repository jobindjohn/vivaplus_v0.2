### Clavicle and Scapula

The clavicle and scapula are modeled as rigid bones. 

### Humerus

For all cortical bones `MAT_PLASTICITY_COMPRESSION_TENSION` is applied as it allows to distinguish between tension and compression and model strain-rate dependency.

The humerus material characteristics are based on Vandenbulcke et al. 2012[@Vandenbulcke2012]. As no anisotropic material model is applied at the current stage, and transversal loading is of higher interest in the considered loading scenarios (no steering wheel), the parameters representative for transverse loading were selected. The bone density was corrected with the factor 1E-3 as there seems to be an error in the original paper (1.9g/mm^2 is out of range compared to other publications) and would lead to a to heavy bone. 

<!-- TODO: Implement strain rate dependency and plasticity (compression and tension). 

Notes for future improvements:

For HUMOS [@Duprey2007], ratios between traction and compression parameters were calculated. Compression parameters divided by the traction parameters of these animal humerus gave the following ratios:

    For the Young modulus E: between 0.34 and 0.5 (0.3 applied)

    For the maximum stress σ max: between 1.15 and 1.5 (1.5 applied)

    For the maximum strain ∊ max: between 2.5 and 3 (2.67 applied)

Using these ratios, compression parameters were found from human traction parameters as follows:

    Young modulus E = 6000 MPa

    Poisson's coefficient ν = 0.3

    Maximum stress σ max = 135 MPa

    Maximum strain ∊ max = 0.04

Tension parameters described in the same publication:

    Young modulus E = 18,000 MPa

    Poisson's coefficient ν = 0.3

    Maximum stress σ max = 90 MPa

    Maximum strain ∊ max = 0.015

### Radius and Ulna

Both bones were modelled elastic with the same material properties as the humerus. 

### Carpals, Metacarpals, and Phalanges

!!! warning "These updates will be released in v0.3.0"
    

The geometry for the bones in the VIVA 50F wrist and hand is from the [PIPER Reference Model](https://gitlab.inria.fr/piper/misc_models/-/tree/master/registration_reference_model/22_REF_LTE635_Assembly). It corresponds to anthropometry of female with height 1610mm, mass 57kg, and age 56 years.

<!-- ### Skin

Skin material properties for the whole upper extremities are based on Flynn et al. 2010[@Flynn2010] using an Ogden material model (without strain rate dependency).
The material properties provided for the posterior side of the upper arm were selected. In future trials the other region-specific material parameters can be tried out. 
Prony series coefficients provided in the paper are also applied 

<!-- (TODO: Check if variables are consistent within simplified example)

### Fat

For the soft tissue, the material form the original VIVA model remained, which are based on a fat tissue model from 

### Muscle 

-->

## Joints

For the VIRTUAL version of the VIVA+ models, joints of the upper extremities will be assumed as kinematic joints.

### Shoulder

### Elbow

- Humerus und ulna are connected with a revolute joint (axis through medial and lateral epicondyle of humerus)
- Humerus and radius are connected with a spherical joint (center of rotation on tip of Radius). 
- The radius and ulna are connected with a spherical joint on the distal end (center of rotation on ulnar styloid)
