# Outputs

## Database Cards

A set of database cards is predefined in the model (in file vivaplus-90+outputs.k). The output frequency can be adjusted in the .key file using the respective parameters. 


## Recommended Criteria

### Lower Extremities
#### Tibia:
A strain-based model specific injury risk curve is currently developed and will be available at the end of the project. Maximum principal strains of the cortical bone are used as output. 

#### Knee:
Risk curve are currently missing â€“ they have to be defined until the end of the project and will be based on total elongation.

#### Femur:
Strain-based model specific injury risk curve are ready to use for shaft and proximal femur and have been calibrated specifically fot the VIVA+ model.Maximum principal strains of the cortical bone are used as output.

#### Pelvis:
The pelvic bone will be further refined outside of VIRTUAL
A preliminary injury criterion will be used in VIRTUAL, which should be used for qualitative evaluations only. 

### Thorax
**Ribs fracture risk:**
The strain-based probabilistic risk assessment based on Maximum principal strains of the cortical bones is ready to use, but not validated now (will be done until project end).

### Neck:

**NIC** is implemented, but not validated specifically for VIVA+. However, the overall kinematics will be validated in rear impact validation loadcases.

**Aldman pressure** can be used for qualitative evaluation. The spine kinematics form the simulation outputs are used as input for the Aldman pressure be used. 

**Neck cross-section**: A crossection is added to analyse forces and moments: The outputs are not validated and not comparable to dummies! This is not a recommended output to be used. 

### Head:
**HIC**:
The response of the VIVA+ model was compared to response of Human and Hybrid III dummy heads. Outputs from the seatbelt accelerometer, positioned at the head CoG should be used. 

**DAMAGE**:
Head rotations will be validated for pedestrian loadcase.Outputs from the seatbelt accelerometer, positioned at the head CoG should be used. 


## Metdata for Dynasaur
The .def files including the object IDs and calculation procedures is available in the viva+ model repo: \model\postprocess\Dynasaur.
