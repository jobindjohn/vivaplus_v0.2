# Positioning with PIPER

Metadata for the positioning of the PIPER model is available wihtin the model files. 

We recommend to apply these steps to poition the model in PIPER:

1. Load PIPER Metadata
   
2. Load Environment Model
   
3. Start Positioning: 
    * Fix bones which should not be positioned (for arms also clavicle and scapula) 
    * It is recommended to use joint controller for positioning and switch of collision detection
    * Adjust spring stiffness if necessary
4. Use Python scripting for set up positioning simulation (Check for ID conflicts with the model!)
5. Run presimulations (global daping recomended)
   ![exemplary dampig setting](..\model\images\Damping.png)
6. Export new nodal coordinates from the d3plots
7. Because of numerical issues (rounding, â€¦) the nodes of some joints are not coincident any more after exporting.  This leads to error termination when starting the positioned model. We have created a jupyter notebook which fixes this problem and sets the joint nodes coincident again.  


This documentation below is highly recommended if you start positioning

## PIPER metadata

The PIPER metadata for VIVA+ is available at `assets/preprocess/PIPER_Metadata` in the repo.
