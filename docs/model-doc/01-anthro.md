# Anthropometry

The anthropometry of VIVA+ average male and female models is given below.

| Gender/Size          | Height (m) | BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) | Age (year) |
|----------------------|:----------:|:----------------------:|:----------:|
| Average Female (50F) |   1.616    |           24           |     50     |
| Average Male (50M)   |   1.753    |           25           |     50     |

## Reference anthropometry

These metrics correspond to the target specified for average dummies from the anthropometric study by Schneider et al. (1983)[@Schneider1983], which forms the basis for most of dummies and computational models in use today. The target average recommended by Schneider et al. corresponded to the average data of the U.S. population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1971-74. Populations around the world have seen a gradual change since then, primarily exhibiting an increasing trend in body mass [@Ogden2004] [@NCDRisC2016] [@NCDRisC2016a]. The VIVA+ baseline models, however, correspond to the anthropometry of widely used dummies and other computational models for purposes of comparison/similarity.

## Mass distribution

For the male, data from Dempster et al., 1967 [@Dempster1967] was used. In this study, the mass in percent for the different body regions (Table 6) as well as the density per body region is presented. Furthermore, Schneider et al. 1983 [@Schneider1983] was used for additional comparison. They have assumed an uniform density throughout the whole body and estimated the mass based on volume distribuions calculated from regression models.

To reach this target mass distribution, the desity of the soft tissue was set to 1.1E-6 kg/mm^3, except the lower extremities (705112, 705142, 705192, 755112, 755142, 755192), where the density was set to 1.24E-6 kg/mm^3.

For the female, unfortunately no comparable dataset is available. It was decided to use a smimilar approach as for the male (use overall flesh density to achieve targeted mass and increase density for the lower extremities, as it was assumed that the lack of mass in the male for the lower extremities was caused by a higher ratio of muscles and simplifications in the leg model causingsveral voids).
A comparison with the EvaRID model (Carlsson et al., 2012) is shown below. An uniform density throughout the whole body and estimated the mass based on volume distribuions calculated from regression models from Young et al., 1983. In Schneider et al. 1983 only mass distributions for the 5th percentile female are included. The mass distribution within the trunk is determined by the representative average geometries from the VIVA+ model. The grouping for this body parts is not alligned with the EvaRID dummy, but armonised with the male, so that the two shown tables are comparable.
