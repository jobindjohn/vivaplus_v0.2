# About VIVA+

The VIVA+ models are a line-up of open source finite element models of vehicle occupants and standing road users.

The baseline model is the average female (50F). All the other models are derivatives of this model. 

<!-- ## FAQs

### Why are there no internal organs?

The design philosophy
### Why do you say the whole lineup of models are a derivative of the average female?

The derivatives have the same elements, but with different nodal coordinates.

### Open and Free? How do you assure the quality and stability of the models?

VIVA+ Maintainer Team. Release workflow

All our models tests and validations are openly available. This will enable anyone to test VIVA+ on their computing platforms to test reproducibility of the models and its validation. We also believe this will allow encourage replicability evaluations among the different available HBMs, increasing our collective confidence in model predictions and use of simulations in the future.


  - What do we do before the release?
    - Quality checks
    - Robustness Checks
    - Validation Catalog
  
### Is it really free? Can I modify the models as I need?

As you need in your research and applications. Free to use as you need

### How can I make a contribution to VIVA+ models?


## Model Roadmap

The VIVA+ models will have stable releases two times a year (planned for March and October)
