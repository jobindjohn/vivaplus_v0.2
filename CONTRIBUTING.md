## Git style guide

### Commits

We adopt the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines for VIVA+ repo. Specifically, begin each commit with one of the following **types**:

```
docs:
feat:
fix:
revert:
test:
validation:
```

Add [scope](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#commit-message-with-scope) of the change to the **type**:

```
docs(model):
docs(userguide):
feat(50F/seated):
fix(50M/standing):

```

#### Commits and [versioning](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#how-does-this-relate-to-semver)

> `fix` type commits should be translated to `PATCH` releases. `feat` type commits should be translated to `MINOR` releases. Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in the commits, regardless of type, should be translated to `MAJOR` releases.

### Issues

Issue templates

Issues are used to discuss and implement features and fixes.

You are welcome on VIVA+ users forum on Zulip if you have a question. Use the [VIVA+ beta users](https://vivaplus.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/240857-VIVA.2B-(beta).20Users) stream to post your questions  on Zulip.

### Merge requests

If your MR is related to other issue(s), reference it by issue number. You can close issues smoothly with [Gitlab keywords](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#default-closing-pattern):

```
close #1
fix #2
resolve #2
Implement #3
```

Those with merge permissions should "Squash and Merge" as a general rule of thumb. This makes reverts easier if they are needed.
